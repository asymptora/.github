## About

Asymptora is a software engineering laboratory focused on the **Java platform** and backend systems design.

Every project here is built from engineering fundamentals: algorithms, data structures, and deliberate architectural decisions. Our work is not about assembling frameworks; it is about understanding the problems deeply enough to make the right trade offs at every layer of the system.

We follow the Java platform closely across versions 21 through 25, applying modern language features not as novelties, but as tools that improve correctness, expressiveness, and runtime efficiency.

> _"An asymptote approaches its limit through continuous refinement. So does good engineering."_
