# Asymptora: Java Software Engineering Lab

### Architecting Scalable, Robust, and Cloud-Native Systems.

---

## Our Mission

Asymptora is an engineering laboratory dedicated to the design and implementation of high-performance software solutions. We specialize in the modern Java ecosystem, adhering to strict architectural standards to deliver systems that are not only functional but maintainable, testable, and scalable.

Our philosophy is grounded in Software Craftsmanship and Engineering First Principles. We do not simply implement frameworks; we architect distributed systems capable of handling enterprise-grade complexity.

## Technical Expertise

Our team possesses a unified, full-stack competency in Java Software Engineering, ensuring consistency and interchangeable expertise across all layers of development.

* **Core Engineering & Architecture**
  Deep specialization in Java (LTS versions), Spring Boot 3, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). We implement Clean Architecture and Hexagonal patterns to decouple business logic from infrastructure, ensuring long-term project viability and testability.

* **Cloud-Native & Distributed Systems**
  Expertise in designing microservices and event-driven architectures using Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ. All solutions are containerized (Docker/Kubernetes) and designed for observability, resilience, and fault tolerance in cloud environments.

## Project Portfolio

Each repository in this organization represents a production-grade implementation of complex software engineering challenges.

### Distributed FinTech Core
* **Lead Engineer:** [Higor Martins](https://github.com/martinshigor)
* **Status:** In Progress
* **Core Stack:** Java 21, Spring Boot 3, PostgreSQL, Docker, Hexagonal Architecture
* **Objective:** Implementation of a high-concurrency payment processing engine. The system features idempotent transaction handling, optimistic locking strategies, and comprehensive integration testing using Testcontainers.
